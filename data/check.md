## Few points

Gathering data:

- collect
- cleansing
- storing

Analyse data:

- regions of origin (students)
- institution of origin
- mobility

Monitoring:

- curriculum
- attendance
- intership and business
- organization for professional contract

                                          FORECASTING ???

## Define the architecture

- What type of NoSQL database ??
- What the data (students databse) can provide us ? What the data can tell us ?
  Do for us ? Help us ?
  > How analyzing it can explain why some regions have fewer students and how to
  > fix it
- Can we automate Spark processing workflows?
- Is out environment secure ?
- Which language will we use ? any preferences ? Why (personal question but
  still important to know)?
- Since there is no database provided, how can we get the dataset ?
  > How can we describe a supinfo database ? Let's put the staff aside then ?
  > What kind of data do Supinfo collect from the students ? Which data do they
  > create themselves ? What Features are we keeping ? Which ones are related to
  > the students ? (is the question redondant ? ) Can the dataset be used as a
  > supinfo representative ? Do we have enough objects (line in out dataset) ?
